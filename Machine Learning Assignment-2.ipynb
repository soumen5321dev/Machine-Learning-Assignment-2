    "helps avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Common Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):\n",
    "How It Works: L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the coefficients (weights) as a penalty to the loss\n",
    "function. The penalty term is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: L1 regularization encourages sparsity, meaning it drives some weights to zero. This can lead to feature\n",
    "selection, as irrelevant features are effectively removed from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):\n",
    "How It Works: L2 regularization adds the squared values of the coefficients (weights) as a penalty to the loss\n",
    "function. The penalty term is proportional to the sum of the squared weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: L2 regularization encourages smaller weights overall, but it doesn’t drive them to zero. It smooths the\n",
    "model by reducing the impact of each individual feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "How It Works: Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It adds both the sum of the absolute values and\n",
    "the sum of the squared values of the weights to the loss function. This allows for a balance between the sparsity\n",
    "of L1 regularization and the weight shrinkage of L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Elastic Net is useful when dealing with highly correlated features, as it balances the benefits of both L1\n",
    "and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Dropout Regularization (for Neural Networks):\n",
    "How It Works: Dropout is a regularization technique specifically for neural networks. During training, it randomly\n",
    "\"drops out\" (sets to zero) a certain percentage of neurons in each layer for every iteration. This prevents the\n",
    "network from becoming too reliant on specific neurons and encourages redundancy in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Dropout reduces the risk of overfitting by ensuring that no single neuron becomes too dominant during the\n",
    "learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Early Stopping:\n",
    "How It Works: Early stopping is a technique where training is halted once the model's performance on a validation\n",
    "set starts to degrade. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data by stopping training before it\n",
    "learns the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: Early stopping effectively limits the model's capacity to overfit by controlling the number of training\n",
    "iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Max-Norm Regularization (for Neural Networks):\n",
    "How It Works: Max-Norm regularization limits the maximum norm of the weights in each layer of a neural network.\n",
    "After each training step, the weight vectors are projected back onto a ball of a fixed radius (defined by a\n",
    "hyperparameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect: By constraining the magnitude of the weight vectors, Max-Norm regularization prevents them from becoming too\n",
